# BotNet

This application consists of multiple bots that can be connected into a peer to peer botnet.
You can then ask the botnet a question and each bot has the chance to give an answer to the question.

## API endpoints:

- /ping
	name
	addr
- /question
	q

See shell script for information on how to build and deploy the containers.
